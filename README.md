# collection_SciPy_scripts
- My own collection of SciPy scripts showing a few selected common ways to perform basic Data, Numerical calculation tasks.
- Most of implemented algorithms has been taken from the book "Introduction to Numerical Programming" by T.A. Beu (2015).
A few - from open sources like Wiki articles.
- **This project is for training only purposes**
- There is no real need to extensively clone it for anyone, except the case if somebody is really interested in any particular
implementation or algorithm. Moreover, all of the implemented here algorithms are well-known and have been implemented already
in all popular packages for numerical calculations.
- All scripts have been developed in the Spyder IDE (4th generation) with major dependecies: Numpy, Matplotlib (I don't see any
necessity to specify it now in any "requirements" file).
