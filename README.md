# collection_numCulc
- My own collection of SciPy scripts showing a few selected common ways to perform basic Numerical calculation tasks.
- Most of implemented numerical algorithms has been taken from the book "Introduction to Numerical Programming" by T.A. Beu (2015).
A few others - from open sources like Wiki articles.
As the reference for the DIP section - "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez R.C., Woods R.E., 2nd or 3rd ed.
- **This project is for training and implementation-refernce only purposes**
- There is no real need to extensively clone it for anyone, except the case if somebody is really interested in any particular
implementation or algorithm. Moreover, all of the implemented here algorithms are well-known and have been implemented already
in all popular packages for numerical calculations. I guess that many guests of this repo was confused in the past by its name.
Hope that renaming will solve this issue.
- All scripts have been developed in the Spyder IDE (4th generation) with common dependecies for numerical calculations:
Scipy(Numpy), Matplotlib, Scikit-Image. I don't see any necessity to specify it now in any "requirements" file for installition
from a scratch.
