# collection_numCulc
- My own collection of Python scripts showing a few selected common ways to perform basic Numerical calculation tasks.
Additionally, this repository contains some my scripts
- Most of implemented numerical algorithms has been taken from the book "Introduction to Numerical Programming" by T.A. Beu (2015).
A few others - from open sources like Wiki articles.
As the reference for the DIP section - "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez R.C., Woods R.E., 2nd or 3rd ed.
Some simulations have been implemented based on other various sources.
- **This project is for training and implementation-refernce only purposes**
- I observed in the past huge traffic of repository cloning. I think thattThere is no real need for doing it, except the case
if somebody is really interested in any particular implementation or algorithm. Moreover, all of the implemented here algorithms
are well-known and have been implemented already in all popular packages for numerical calculations. I guess that many cloners
of this repo were confused in the past by its previous name. Renaming, so far, solved the issue.
- All scripts have been developed in the Spyder IDE (4th generation) with common dependecies for numerical calculations:
Scipy(Numpy), Matplotlib, Scikit-Image. I don't see any necessity to specify it now in any "requirements" file for installation
from a scratch.
