# collection_numCalc
- This repository contains my own collection of Python scripts containing some common numerical calculation algorithms (e.g., numerical integration) 
and some particular simulations / evaluations (e.g., microscopic images with fluorescent beads, their Brownian motion in water). 
- Most of implemented numerical algorithms have been taken from the book "Introduction to Numerical Programming" by
T.A. Beu (2015). A few others - from open sources like Wiki articles. As the reference for the DIP section - "Digital
Image Processing" by Gonzalez R.C., Woods R.E., 2nd / 3rd ed.
- *Note that this project is for training and implementation-reference only purposes, so there aren't yet any installation instructions*. 
One, maybe, may find that it's more useful to implement these scripts as the Jupyter notebooks, but I prefer 
the 'script form' for possible further reusing of the functions implemented in scripts.
- *Also note that the most of implemented here algorithms are well-known and had been already implemented in all popular packages for numerical calculations*.
- Common dependencies across almost all scripts: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), 
[SciPy](https://scipy.org/). For Digital Imaging Process (DIP for short) also: [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/).
Used IDE for scripts development: [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). 

Feb. 2024 update: Since someone found this repository useful, I've refined this short documentation to clarify the bullet points above.
