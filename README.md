# collection_numCalc
- My own collection of Python scripts with a few basic Numerical calculation tasks, some simulation / evaluation scripts. 
- Most of implemented numerical algorithms has been taken from the book "Introduction to Numerical Programming" by
T.A. Beu (2015). A few others - from open sources like Wiki articles. As the reference for the DIP section - "Digital
Image Processing" by Gonzalez R.C., Woods R.E., 2nd / 3rd ed. Some simulations have been implemented based on other
sources (mostly, open).
- **This project is for training and implementation-reference only purposes, so there aren't yet any installation instructions**
- I observed in the past huge traffic of repository cloning. Moreover, the most of implemented
here algorithms are well-known and have been implemented already in all popular packages for numerical calculations.
I guess that many cloners of this repo were confused in the past by its previous name. Renaming, so far, resolved the
issue.
- All scripts have been developed in the Spyder IDE with common dependencies for numerical calculations: scipy(numpy),
matplotlib, scikit-image (skimage), pyqt5, pyqtgraph. I don't see any necessity to specify it now in any "requirements" file for
installation from a scratch. In the case of any interest, please, refer to import sections of the scripts.
