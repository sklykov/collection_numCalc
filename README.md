# collection_numCalc
- My own collection of Python scripts showing a few selected common ways to perform basic Numerical calculation tasks.
Additionally, this repository contains some of my simulation / evaluation scripts.
- Most of implemented numerical algorithms has been taken from the book "Introduction to Numerical Programming" by
T.A. Beu (2015). A few others - from open sources like Wiki articles. As the reference for the DIP section - "Digital
Image Processing" by Gonzalez R.C., Woods R.E., 2nd / 3rd ed. Some simulations have been implemented based on other
sources.
- **This project is for training and implementation-reference only purposes**
- I observed in the past huge traffic of repository cloning. I think that there is no real need for doing it, except the
case if somebody is really interested in any particular implementation or algorithm. Moreover, all of the implemented
here algorithms are well-known and have been implemented already in all popular packages for numerical calculations.
I guess that many cloners of this repo were confused in the past by its previous name. Renaming, so far, resolved the
issue.
- All scripts have been developed in the Spyder IDE with common dependecies for numerical calculations: scipy(numpy),
matplotlib, scikit-image (skimage). I don't see any necessity to specify it now in any "requirements" file for
installation from a scratch.
